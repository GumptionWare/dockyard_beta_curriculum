## Blog: Seeding

You're going to create a seed file for your existing [Blog](./blog_setup.livemd) project.
The seed file should:

You should have blog posts associated with comments. If not, you can generate the project with the following command.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
$ mix phx.new blog
$ mix phx.gen.html Posts Post posts title:string subtitle:string content:text
$ mix phx.gen.html Comments Comment comments content:text post_id:references:posts
$ mix ecto.migrate
```

Ideally, you should complete the previous [Blog: Comments](./blog_comments.livemd) exercise. However, it is not strictly necessary.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Blog: Seeding

Use the `priv/repo/seeds.exs` file to seed your database with:

1. A blog post without any comments.
2. A blog post with an associated comment.

Once complete, use your seed file to seed the database.

```
$ mix ecto.reset
```

Then display comments on your `Post` show page.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Push to GitHub

From the `blog` folder run the following commands.

First, ensure that all tests pass.

```
mix test
```

Then stage and commit your changes to the Blog project.

```
git add .
git commit -m "seed comments and posts and add comments to posts"
git push
```
